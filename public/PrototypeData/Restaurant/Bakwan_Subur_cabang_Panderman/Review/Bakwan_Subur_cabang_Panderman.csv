"Eventhough this one was only a little stall and branch, but the location is beside Nasi Pencel Pincuk Winongo. After finishing Nasi Pecel, I usually have Bakwan Subur. Most of their dishes were tasty, especially panjang, paru and bakso kasar. This one was not Halal because contain pork. Price wise only 3000 IDR per piece.",5
First time went here and it was not busy at the time i arrived. Actually it is a not so spacious eatery. There are few other food stalls besode the bakso stall. The bakso is really delicious. I also love their various gorengan and siomay. â€¦,5
"Non-halal meatballs because they use pork raw materials. It tastes good, the service is friendly, just a bit long. The place in a kind of small food court is a bit uncomfortable. Branch of Bakwan Lush Jalan Wuni.",5
Cool and comfortable place. Baso is not halal. The flavor of the sauce is not salty,5
"The waiter was not friendly at all, just once there, God forbid",1
"The taste is the same as Bakwan Subur in the center. It's just that the price is a little more expensive even though it's fellow Bakwan Subur. But the service is good, the employees are friendly and very helpful.",5
